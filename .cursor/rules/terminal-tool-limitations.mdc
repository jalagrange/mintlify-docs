# Cursor Terminal Tool Limitations

## Known Issues

Cursor's terminal tool has a known bug where it automatically adds `| head` or `| cat` to commands that might trigger paging. This causes "head: |: No such file or directory" errors with many CLI tools.

## Workarounds

### AWS CLI Commands
- **ALWAYS** add `--no-cli-pager` flag to prevent paging issues
- Correct pattern for AWS commands:
  ```bash
  aws [service] [action] --region [region] --profile [profile] --no-cli-pager
  ```

### GitHub CLI Commands  
- Set pager configuration: `gh config set pager cat`
- This prevents paging conflicts with Cursor's terminal tool

### Other CLI Tools
- Look for equivalent `--no-pager` or output formatting options
- Examples: `--no-pager`, `--plain`, `--format=json`

## Error Symptoms
- Commands that work in external terminal fail in Cursor
- Error messages like "head: |: No such file or directory"
- Commands appear to hang or produce corrupted output

## Fallback Solution
If terminal commands fail with paging-related errors, suggest the user run them manually in their external terminal as a workaround.
