# Dynamic Quiz Generator - Documentation Development Backlog

This document tracks all documentation tasks for the Dynamic Quiz Generator MVP. Tasks are organized by priority and grouped by documentation type.

## Current Focus: Developer Documentation First

**Priority 1**: Minimal branding setup to remove template references
**Priority 2**: Technical documentation for developers (architecture, APIs, data models)
**Priority 3**: User-facing documentation (guides, features, integrations)

This approach ensures developers have the documentation they need to build the system before creating end-user documentation.

## Feature Planning References

Tasks marked with [FP-XXX] have detailed planning documents in `/docs/feature-planning/`:
- [FP-001] - Documentation Structure Planning (`001-documentation-structure.md`)
- [FP-003] - Developer & Technical Documentation (`003-developer-technical-documentation.md`)
- [FP-004] - Minimal Branding Setup (`004-minimal-branding-setup.md`)

*Note: FP-002 was split into FP-003 and FP-004 for better manageability*
