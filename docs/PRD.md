Dynamic Quiz Creator  

1. Objective 

To enable learners to assess their knowledge , helping them identify content that may be unnecessary for them to complete. This tool supports personalized learning paths, improves time efficiency, and empowers learners with greater control over their development journey. 

2. Background 

Given a document (e.g.a Go1 course, a video, etc.) a quiz can be generated that assesses competency. Basic options to edit/configure the quiz may be available based on the userâ€™s role.  

3. Target Users 

Proof of concept for end learners and managers 

3.1 User Goals 

Skip unnecessary content based on existing knowledge 

Gain awareness of knowledge gaps 

Save time by focusing only on new material 

Track knowledge growth over time 

4. Features & Functionality (MVP) 

The goal of this PoC is to demonstrate that learners can take AI-generated quizzes built from structured content (HTML, PDF, video transcript), receive meaningful feedback by topic, and make informed decisions on whether to proceed with a course â€” all without needing manual quiz creation or advanced authoring tools.

9. Risks & Mitigations 

Risk 

Mitigation 

Poor quality AI-generated questions 

Human-in-the-loop review process 

Learner distrust in skipping recommendations 

Provide transparent scoring and result breakdown 

Lack of course content standardization 

Pilot with a subset of content types 

 

10. Timeline (High-Level) 

Design & Architecture: July 2025 

Prototype & AI Integration: August 2025 

Author Review Tools: Augustâ€“September 2025 

User Testing & Feedback: September 2025 

MVP Release (proof of concept MVP): October 2025 

11. Open Questions 

What threshold determines if a course or module is skippable? 

Should we offer different quiz types depending on content complexity? 

What feedback do content providers need to feel confident in the AI-generated questions? 

 

 

System Architecture  

1. Purpose 

This document defines the modular system architecture for the Dynamic Quiz Creator MVP. It outlines the agents, services, and orchestrators needed to support AI-driven quiz generation, delivery, scoring, and learner profiling. 

 

2. Architectural Overview 

The system is composed of modular agents grouped into functional layers. Each layer performs a specialized role with clear handoffs to the next.
