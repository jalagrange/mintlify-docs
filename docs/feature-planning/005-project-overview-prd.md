# Feature Planning 005: Project Overview & PRD Integration

## Feature Overview

Create a developer-friendly version of the Project Requirements Document (PRD) that provides essential project context, goals, and requirements. This should be the first thing developers read to understand what they're building and why.

## Objectives

1. Make the PRD accessible and discoverable in the documentation
2. Present project context in a developer-friendly format
3. Provide clear understanding of users, goals, and MVP scope
4. Establish foundation knowledge before technical documentation
5. Align development team on project vision and requirements

## Current PRD Analysis

The existing PRD (`/docs/PRD.md`) contains:
- Project objectives and background
- Target users and user goals
- MVP features and functionality
- System architecture overview
- Timeline and success metrics
- Risks and dependencies

## Technical Approach

### 1. Content Strategy

#### Developer-Focused Sections
```
Project Overview
├── What We're Building - Clear product description
├── Who It's For - User personas and use cases  
├── Why It Matters - Business value and learning outcomes
├── MVP Scope - What's included and excluded
├── Success Metrics - How we measure success
├── Timeline - Key milestones and MVP target
└── Architecture Overview - High-level system design
```

#### Content Transformation
- **Convert business language to technical context**
- **Add developer-relevant details** 
- **Include technical constraints and requirements**
- **Highlight integration points and dependencies**

### 2. Navigation Integration

#### Primary Location
Add to "Getting Started" tab as the first page:

```json
{
  "tab": "Getting Started",
  "groups": [
    {
      "group": "Overview",
      "pages": [
        "project-overview",    // NEW - PRD content
        "index",              // Current landing page
        "quickstart"          // Current quickstart
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Cross-References
Link from other key pages:
- Landing page → Project overview
- Architecture docs → Project context
- API reference → Use cases and user flows

### 3. Content Structure

# Dynamic Quiz Creator - Project Overview

## What We're Building

AI-powered assessment tool for personalized learning paths...

## Target Users & Use Cases

### Primary Users
1. **Learners** - Assess knowledge before starting courses
2. **Content Authors** - Review and approve AI-generated questions  
3. **Administrators** - Manage quiz settings (future)

### User Goals
- Skip unnecessary content based on existing knowledge
- Gain awareness of knowledge gaps
- Save time by focusing only on new material
- Track knowledge growth over time

## MVP Features & Scope

### Included in MVP
- AI-generated questions from content (HTML, PDF, transcripts)
- Multiple question types (MC, T/F, Fill-blank, Short answer)
- Basic scoring and topic-based recommendations
- Simple learner profile storage
- Author review and edit capability

### Explicitly Out of Scope (MVP)
- Admin dashboards and analytics
- Full authentication integration  
- Rich media processing
- Advanced adaptive questioning

## System Architecture Overview

[Include high-level architecture diagram and brief explanation]

## Timeline & Milestones

- **MVP Target**: October 2025
- **Current Phase**: Documentation and architecture (July 2025)
- **Next Phase**: Development and AI integration (Aug-Sep 2025)

## Success Metrics

- % of learners who take pre-course assessments
- Learner satisfaction with quiz feature
- Quality of AI-generated questions
```

### 4. Developer-Specific Enhancements

#### Technical Context Additions
- **Technology constraints** (Node.js 18+, AI model requirements)
- **Integration requirements** (REST APIs, data formats)
- **Performance considerations** (rate limiting, processing time)
- **Security requirements** (data privacy, content protection)

#### Development-Relevant Information
- **Data flow examples** for each user journey
- **API surface area** overview
- **Third-party dependencies** and services
- **Deployment and infrastructure** considerations

### 5. Visual Elements

#### Diagrams and Visual Aids

    A[Content Upload] --> B[AI Processing]
    B --> C[Question Generation]
    C --> D[Author Review]
    D --> E[Quiz Publication]
    E --> F[Learner Assessment]
    F --> G[Results & Recommendations]
```

#### User Flow Examples
- **Learner Journey**: Course access → Quiz → Results → Decision
- **Author Journey**: Content upload → AI generation → Review → Publish
- **System Flow**: Processing pipeline from content to recommendations

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Content Creation (Day 1-2)
1. Create `project-overview.mdx` with developer-focused PRD content
2. Add visual elements and diagrams
3. Update navigation in docs.json

### Phase 2: Integration (Day 3)
1. Link from landing page and quickstart
2. Add cross-references to upcoming technical docs
3. Test all navigation links

### Phase 3: Validation (Day 4)
1. Review content for technical accuracy
2. Ensure alignment with original PRD objectives
3. Validate that developers have sufficient context
